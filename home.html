        <h2>Bracing for an unlikely hobby</h2>
        <p class="date"><b>Dated:</b> February 1st, 2018</p>
        <p>No, it wasn't a piece of cake, probably because I am not a seasoned programmer? But then even that takes years and years of practice and I can be described as nothing but a green leaf. A 29-year-old with accounting background, passionate about Social Sciences and into a full-time Real Estate business, computer science was furthest from my mind, not that it did not pique my interest. Furthermore, I sort of picked this up for a hobby very recently, still racking my brains as to how it all started. All I seem to remember is that I was browsing my facebook until I came across an advert for <cite>Codecademy</cite> and thought to give it a try. One thing led to another, and that was the beginning of an addiction getting stronger day by day.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a> proved to be quite interactive, in fact, highly recommended to those who would like to be introduced to the world of web designing, as it starts out with basic HTML Course in a highly user-friendly interface, and the lessons that follows, without even charging you a single buck. It also offers a PRO package for $19.99 a month, giving you real-life projects for further practice, with 24/7 support from resident experts. Now, before you are misled by the notion that I have any vested interests in the aforementioned company whatsoever, let me assure you that I used up only the freebies and have not spent a single buck on it...yet ;).</p>
        <p>Moving on from Codecademy, it was time to start browsing other courses available online for further research, focusing largely on HTML5 and CSS3. It led me to <a href="https://alison.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Alison</strong></a>, which offers free online courses/diplomas on various subjects, currently used by around 11 million learners worldwide based on 1,000+ Courses to choose from. By then it had given me enough of a taste for web development to initiate my own project, to create a platform which maps out my mind, for what is an expression, if not expressed. However, let me not give you a wrong impression here, for if you are expecting this platform to be another one of those geeky websites offering tutorials, I hate to disappoint you. This space is more likely to turn out, at least that is what my intentions are, to be the ravings of a lunatic.</p>
